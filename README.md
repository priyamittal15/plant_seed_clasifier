# plant_seed_clasifier
using keras and artificial neural network build one model that predict the seed in plant out of 12 seed species
i am still working over their 90-95 % work has been done rest i am still working over their i just upload it to send this file to UNSCHOOL Learning as under them i am working over this project. 12 Species of Seeds are :
1> Black-grass 
2>Charlock 
3>Cleavers 
4>Common Chickweed 
5>Common wheat 
6>Fat Hen 
7>Loose Silky-bent 
8>Maize 
9>Scentless Mayweed 
10>Shepherds Purse 
11>Small-flowered Cranesbill 
12>Sugar beet

the model can predict the species from above mentioned one only.
